## HOM3R-Viewer

HOM3R-Viewer is a 3D viewer for complex products that integrates the hom3r-engine library offering all its functions. hom3r-viewer has been developed in Unity, which allows it to be deployed on multiple platforms.

The HOM3R-Viewer has been developed in the framework of the Use-It-Wisely (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/609027) and Pluggy (https://www.pluggy-project.eu/) projects. It includes all the algorithms presented in the PhD thesis developed by Daniel Gónzalez Toledo. 

The documentation of everything is going to take a long time, but if you have any doubts or queries please do not hesitate to contact us (Contact: areyes@uma.es or dgonzalezt@uma.es).

Official website of the project is https://proyectos.diana.uma.es/hom3r

## Examples of HOM3R-Viewe usage

These developments have been used in the tools developed throughout the Use-It-Wisely and PLUGGY projects. In particular, it is possible to publicly use the 3D applications developed in the Pluggy (https://pluggy.eu/exhibitions?type=ar) project on desktop, web and mobile platforms, for augmented reality and virtual reality environments (see the videos at https://www.pluggy-project.eu/pluggy3d/).

## Credits

This software is one of the main contributions of the PhD thesis “Interacción 3D con objetos complejos” by Daniel González-Toledo, but the whole 3DI-DIANA team has contributed to the library, its deployment in the applications developed for Use-it-Wisely and PLUGGY project and all the technical testing. The development has been coordinated by [Arcadio Reyes-Lecuona](https://github.com/areyesl) ([Diana Research Group, University of Malaga](https://www.diana.uma.es/?page_id=53)).
